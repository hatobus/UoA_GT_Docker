		\subsection{Graduation Thesis}
			Graduation Theses" is a required course offered for fourth-year students on a year-round basis to which eight units of academic credits are allotted. This is the only required course and offered on a year-round basis at the University. This is the most important course which integrates what students have studied at the University for four years.
			
			Students must conduct their research on their own initiative to complete their graduation theses under thorough supervision based on individualized instruction given by relevant supervisors.
			
			The University has obliged all students to write their graduation thesis in English since the University was established, and this is one of the reasons that individuals graduated from the University have gained a high reputation from various quarters.
			
			Certain requirements must be fulfilled in order to initiate a graduation thesis, and due procedures must be taken for acquisition of the academic credits for this course.
			
		\subsection{Review of Graduation Thesis}
			Graduation theses shall be reviewed by a relevant supervisor and one referee, two referees in total.
			
			Ratio between weights of evaluation conducted by the supervisor and the referee is two to one.
			
			Comprehensive evaluations will be conducted, taking into consideration the items below.

			\end{itemize}
			
		\subsection{Submission of Completed Theses}
